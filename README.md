## Overview
<div>
    <p>I decided to analyze data regarding space missions for a simple data processing, analysis, and visualization project.</p>
    <p>The main focus of this project is the number of missions each country conducted and the percentage of success they had.</p>
    <p>This project led me to conclude that is it necessary to consider the total number of samples before considering percentages to extract a good conclusion.</p>
</div>

## Data Source
<div>
    <p>I extracted the data from a Kaggle project called: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/kanncaa1/space-mission-from-1957-data-analysis/input" _target="blank">Space Mission from 1957 Data Analysis</a></p>
    <p>It is <b>required to log in</b> in order to download the CSV file. But beyond that is it free to get the data.</p>
</div>

## Technologies
<div>
    <p>This project involves the usage of the following technologies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Python</b></li>
        <li><b>Pandas</b></li>
        <li><b>Matplotlib</b></li>
    </ul>
</div>

## Graphs Extracted
<div>
    <p>The following are the graphs I created in base of the analysis I made</p>
    <div>
        <p>1. Graph about countries and the number of missions each of them conducted</p>
        <img src="countries_n_mission_num_bar_chart.png" alt="Countries vs Number of Missions Bar Chart"> 
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <p>2. Graph about countries and the percentage of successful missions each of them conducted.</p>

    </div>
<div>

## Conclusion
<div>
    <p>From the charts I conclude that <b>the United States of America is the most reliable country in regards to space missions</b> because it has a <b>high percentage of success missions</b> and it is the country that launched <b>the most space missions</b> according to the analyzed data set.</p>
